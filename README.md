# SVC Classification Analysis

## Project Overview
This project implements a Support Vector Classifier (SVC), a supervised machine learning algorithm used for
classification tasks. The model separates classes using an optimal hyperplane in a high-dimensional space.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Algorithm Used
- Support Vector Machine (SVC)
- Kernel-based classification

## Files in the Repository
- `SVC.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing SVC implementation, training, and evaluation

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/svc-classification-analysis.git
